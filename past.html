        <h1>A bit about my past</h1>

        <p>I've always had in interest in technology, there was always something
            I was tinkering or messing around with, whether that was an old camera,
            a broken phone or a semi-functioning laptop. Most nights and weekends
            were spent with a computer or device in hand.</p>

        <p>This interest continued through school and sure enough I found myself
            doing technical subjects (IPT and electronics), during high school I
            also did a bit of IT work including some freelance web development and
            contract work in networking. This experience solidified the idea that I
            was going to pursue a career in IT.</p>

        <p>And so it was inevitable that I now find myself studying IT.</p>

        <p>I also still spend most of my free time tinkering with technology,
            recently I switched to Linux and have been slowly learning more and
            more, one thing I enjoy about Linux is the immense amount of
            configurability and customisation that is possible. My current Linux
            setup on my laptop looks like this:</p>

            <a href="rice2.png"><img class="riceImg" src="rice2-smol.png" alt="rice image 2"></a>
